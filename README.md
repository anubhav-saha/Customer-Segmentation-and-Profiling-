# Customer-Segmentation-and-Profiling-
In this project, we are examining a customer dataset provided by a Telecommunications company. Our objective is to perform segmentation of this customer dataset based on certain metrics that we need to identify. These metrics or the segmentation drivers can be identified after performing a thorough exploratory analysis of our dataset. The segmentation of our customer dataset would allow us to profile our customers based on those metrics which would then help us to work on strategies that would ensure better customer retention and lesser churn rate. Now to identify these metrics that would drive our segmentation project, we start with performing an exploratory analysis of our customer dataset.
